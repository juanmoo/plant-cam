- Optimize for speed from possibly large image sets

### 4. Web Frontend
- Simple interface for selecting time ranges and video options
- Preview or download final videos

## Storage
- Images organized by timestamp and device

## Requirements
- Hourly upload latency max
- Fast, responsive video generation

## Milestones
- Pi upload + backend storage
- Video generation API & UI
- Final optimization
